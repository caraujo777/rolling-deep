 if scott pruitt is serious about serving as our next epa administrator he should be more than willing to provide epwdems complete answers 
 scott pruitt has been openly hostile to the epa s basic protections for our environment and public health 
 it disappointing that democrat epw committee members are unwilling to vote on the nomination of agscottpruitt to lead epa delayocrats 
 fyi pruitt has answered 1 200 qs that s 1 000 more qs than incoming nominees for epa head from obama bush and clinton administrations 
 scott pruitt has sued the epa over 20 times as our next epa administrator would he continue this assault on the agency from the inside

 the epa must live up to its mission and continue cleaning up radioactive waste in niagara county the residents deserve better 
 this would erode us leadership in tackling climate change amp set us back years in hastening clean energy amp job creation woefully misguided 
 deeply disappointed by epa s decision to withdraw from the clean power plan 
 the epa has a clear obligation to address carbon emissions amp the clean power plan was helping to achieve that goal 
 epa estimated the clean power plan would cut emissions from power plants 32 below 2012 levels by 2030 improving public health 
 along w withdrawal from parisagreement this decision undermines our commitment to fight climate change amp embrace a clean energy future 
 dismantling clean power plan one more glaring example how this administration can t grasp climate change reality 
 to everyone in the areas impacted by the wildfires in napa and sonoma please heed evacuation orders amp stay safe 
 the trump admin s irresponsible dangerous assault on our environment continues the need for positive action on climate change is now 
 great to see administrator pruitt do away with president obama job killing epa power plan itsanewday 
 an administration that cared about upholding the epa mission wouldn t reverse a lifesaving plan that prioritizes public health 
 the cleanpowerplan was a historic step in combating climate change and protecting the health of our kids and future generations 
 repealing the cleanpowerplan will let power plants dump unlimited amounts of pollution into the atmosphere a very misguided move 
 with kyfb senatemajldr amp epascottpruitt at mahan farms in paris great to have an epa that protects environment w out destroying jobs 
 we can t afford to ignore climatechange citizens must speak out states amp congress must act to cut pollution amp save clean energy economy 
 epa announcement is a huge relief for missourians who faced double digit utility bill hikes under so called cpp 
 epa terminates obama s climate plan 
 for safety information about the wildfires in napa and sonoma please follow cal_oes amp cal_fire 
 scientific consensus finds that climate change is a man made threat to humanity 
 since taking office the trump admin has chosen to promote interests of friends in fossil fuel industry ahead of our safety and security 
 i m troubled by epascottpruitt s decision to repeal clean air plan which will cut efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions 
 epascottpruitt we need to tackle climatechange bc the stakes are too high consequences are too devastating leave this problem to future generations

 epascottpruitt epa senatorshaheen repanniekuster repsheaporter read the troubling report about the epa weakening regulations around toxic chemicals here 
 epascottpruitt is firing qualified scientists to make room for individuals sponsored by the very same industries epa is meant to regulate

 epascottpruitt epa pruitt repeatedly silenced epa scientists and denied science inconvenient to his agenda now he s trying to get rid of scientists altogether 
 i strongly oppose the changes that epascottpruitt is proposing to make to the epa science advisory board 
 epascottpruitt epa scott pruitt s crusade to delegitimize the work of nonpartisan scientists endangers the health of every american it cannot be tolerated 
 these changes fundamentally upend the role that science should play in policy at the epa 
 this reflects a disturbing trend at epa where epascottpruitt is systematically subverting science as part of the policymaking process 
 epascottpruitt new epa policy prohibits any scientist receiving epa funding from serving on advisory panels more seats for scientists on industry payroll

 it is time for new leadership at the epa read my full statement on administrator pruitt s resignation here gt ny21 
 with a leadership change at epa i look forward to potus nominating an administrator who will continue efforts to keep our environment healthy and our economy strong 
 this step was long overdue scottpruittok was never the right choice to lead the epa amp his scandal plagued tenure has been an embarrassment to the agency amp grossly disrespectful to american taxpayers 
 the controversies surrounding the former administrator of epa had become a major impediment amp necessitated a leadership change i am hopeful that under new leadership the agency will be in a better position to carry out the important work of protecting our natural environment 
 while this doesn undo any of the reckless decisions pruitt has made it does provide an opportunity for us to stop being distracted by his misconduct and refocus on the consequential policy being made at the epa every day 
 scott pruitt departure is long overdue his actions as epa administrator not only raised serious ethical concerns but hurt iowa farmers by recklessly undercutting the renewable fuel standard 1 2 
 it is my hope that acting administrator andrew wheeler will uphold the president s commitment to the rfs and get the epa back on track 2 2 
 i respect potus decision to accept administrator pruitt resignation and sincerely hope his next choice to head the epa will implement e15yearround while supporting a strong renewable fuel standard and reducing burdensome regulations on our nation agriculture producers 
 mr pruitt resignation is long overdue i voted against his nomination because it was clear he did not support the epa mission as it turned out that was only part of the problem his ethical failings are too numerous to recount amp i glad that he is finally stepping down 
 clear it was time for a major change at the epa and for scott pruitt to go 
 congrats to deputy administrator andrew wheeler an ohio native who will now be serving as acting administrator of the epa given his decades of public service including time at the epa his dedication to the american people will be greatly appreciated in this new interim role
