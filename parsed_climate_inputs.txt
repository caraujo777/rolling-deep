"Reflecting on yesterday's @AESymposium and I'm honored to be a part of such a crucial conversation among all parties impacted by the wellbeing of our Arctic lands.\n\nSecuring this future means looking at many perspectives\u2014energy, environment, security, economy and justice. https://t.co/bQmRKhO1sF"
"On the ancestral lands of the Duwamish, Suquamish and Coast Salish tribes, it is crucial to recognize that Native peoples across the globe have shown us what leadership looks like on the environmental and community issues that matter most. It's our duty to learn from that wisdom."
"Climate change is real and it is caused by humans.\n\nArctic sea ice is melting at alarming rates, we are experiencing more frequent temperature extremes, carbon emissions are on the rise. Pollutants run into our Duwamish River, and acidification threatens our oceans and economy."
"It's a grave threat if those in power deny climate science. On both sides of the aisle, we see the facts, but money in politics can sadly help people forget the long-term effects of short-term actions.\n\nIn truth, the fate of our planet is and always has been a bipartisan issue."
"We can't forget it was many Republican presidents who helped construct the environmental state: Teddy Roosevelt pushed the federal system of parks, forests and monuments. Richard Nixon created the EPA.\n\nNow, this administration threatens decades of bipartisan environmental work."
"From the Trump administration's attempts to repeal the Clean Power Plan that protects Americans from dangerous pollutants, to rollbacks of regulations that protect our air and water, to oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge\u2014so much is at stake."
"Healthy industry relies on healthy environment.\n\nWe can't bring billions to our economy if our beautiful lands disappear. We can't feed families or employ hundreds of thousands if pollution sinks our maritime industry. We won't survive without the environment, we must defend it."
"We can never take back what we give away. We can't drill our way to energy efficiency in a world that is moving away from fossil fuels. The potential gains of Arctic drilling are short-term and uncertain. The cost is deep, irreversible and disproportionately borne by some."
"\u27a1\ufe0fBlack people in U.S. are 3x more likely to have asthma due to climate impacts\n\u27a1\ufe0fThose in poverty face higher risks of extreme heat and air pollution\n\u27a1\ufe0fIndigenous people are more often exposed to toxins\n\nFrontline communities feel climate change's impact first and worst."
"In Congress, I'm proud to have formed the United for Climate and Environmental Justice Task Force with @RepMcEachin and @RepBarragan to give voice to frontline communities and establish an office of environmental justice in the EPA and the Oval Office."
"I am pushing for investment in research on climate resiliency, new energy, and sustainable practices to better understand and invest in our environment.\n\nI'm also thrilled to co-sponsor the #100by50Act to transition our nation to 100% renewable energy by the year 2050. https://t.co/LLxd1spxbZ"
"We have so much work to do moving forward to secure our climate and environmental justice for all, but I know that if we allow ourselves, we'll see that nature and democracy are deeply intertwined.\n\nFor our children, our communities and our future, we must prioritize this fight."
